### Project Overview
This project aims to explore usage trends of the Bikeshare system using data from both 2011 and 2012. By leveraging various visualizations such as bar charts and scatter plots, the project seeks to uncover patterns in bike rental behavior.

### Data Preparation
A preliminary scan using the skim function was conducted to identify columns containing missing values. Since these missing entries were determined to have minimal impact on the overall analysis, they were omitted. Additionally, month labels were manually defined, and chart attributes were standardized for consistent styling across all visualizations.

The dataset was also filtered to isolate records from 2012 for focused analysis on that specific year.

### Data Visualizations
A variety of visualizations were created to explore and interpret different aspects of the dataset.

### Tools
- R, RStudio
- dplyr, skimr, and ggplot2 libray to analyze the dataset.
